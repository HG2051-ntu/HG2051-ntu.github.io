<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This project constitutes 30% of your final grade for HG2051. Please
work on the final program and report individually. Your code will be
assessed based on its functionality, simplicity, and efficiency. Your
writeup will be assessed based on its organization, clarity, and
comprehensiveness as well as the quality of the reflections and
discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your programming
and reasoning abilities by working on a problem individually. If you
have an idea for another project that you would like to do instead, talk
to me for approval.</p></li>
<li><p>Project 1 involves developing resources for an under-resourced
language. Submission requirements include your data, output, and
annotated code along with a short writeup describing your goals,
process, and results. Additionally, this project dovetails with the
group project (<a href="project2.html">Project 2</a>), which means you
may want to determine your group ahead of time so that all members can
choose related languages to work on for the individual project.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="project-1-part-of-speech-tagging-for-low-resource-languages">Project
1: Part of Speech tagging for low-resource languages</h2>
<p>Part of speech (POS) tagging is a way to automatically identify the
word class of a particular lexical item in a string of text. A decent
part of speech tagger can help to facilitate other downstream tasks such
as machine translation. Languages that are widely used have more
resources in this regard, but what about for languages with few
speakers?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The purpose of this project is to expand on annotated data that
can be used to train a POS-tagger for a language with few NLP resources.
The project will help you think through the steps necessary for
developing the correct kind of data, as well as how to write code that
can assist with this annotation, and will additionally require you to
gain some expertise in the low-resource language you have chosen. In
Project 2, the data may be used to actually develop a POS-tagger for
this language using existing tools in the NLTK library.</p></li>
<li><p>Our primary data source will be the <em><a
href="https://github.com/lingdoc/taggedPBC/">taggedPBC</a></em>, a
dataset that has been created to support crosslinguistic research. This
dataset has been automatically tagged for POS and dependencies by
leveraging machine translation models to transfer information from
English to nearly 2,000 languages. However, due to the nature of the
source and target languages, there is a large amount of noise in this
dataset: while nouns and verbs are identified with decent accuracy
across languages, other word types are not, partly due to the fact that
English contains word classes (like articles) <em>not present</em> in
many languages, while at the same time it does not contain word classes
(like numeral classifiers) that <em>are present</em> in many
languages.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For an example of what the data looks like, click <a
href="https://github.com/lingdoc/taggedPBC/blob/main/corpora/conllu/nyb-eng-tagged-nyb-x-bible_parsed.conllu">here</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This means that there is much room to improve the annotations of
each individual corpus in this dataset. While the “gold standard”
typically involves hand-tagging corpora, automated pipelines can greatly
speed up this process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial project code in your personal repository for this
assignment will help you to get started, along the following lines.</p>
<h3 id="choose-your-language-and-data">Choose your language and
data</h3>
<p>The first step in developing a POS-tagger is finding texts that can
be used to train and validate it. For this we are using the
<em>taggedPBC</em> data, but we need to choose a language to work on. To
find a language, please view options at the following URL: <a
href="project_lgs_HG2051.html">HG2051 Project languages</a></p>
<p>Listed languages are organized by language family. Selecting the
language family on the linked page will show you the names of the
languages of that family that are found in the <em>taggedPBC</em>, along
with basic information, a direct link to the corpus, and links to
additional sources regarding the language. As this project is a
precursor to your group project, you may want to find others who are
interested in working on languages within the same family, since this
will help you to pool your expertise for Project 2. These languages have
also been selected based on their lack of available resources, to ensure
that we are maximizing our contributions to the field of NLP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: <em>For this project you may not work on
the same language as another student. Email the instructor with your
preferred choice (ISO 639-3 code and name). This will be on a
first-come-first-served basis. If you choose a language that proves
extremely difficult to work with, please contact the instructor at the
earliest opportunity to explore other options.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="get-the-base-text-for-the-low-resource-language">Get the base
text for the low-resource language</h4>
<p>Once your language choice has been approved, download the linked
CoNNL-U corpus and copy/move it to your personal project repository.
Make sure to <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, and
<code>push</code> the changes to update your personal Github repository
with the corpus. This will be the main data file that your work is based
on.</p>
<h4 id="understand-the-code">Understand the code</h4>
<p>Starter code in your repo parses the CoNLL-U file and allows you to
modify the output. You should first read through the code and try to
understand how it works: how does the code extract existing words and
POS tags? how are particular verses extracted?</p>
<h4 id="understand-the-language">Understand the language</h4>
<p>Look for existing research on this language. Since the data comes
from a Bible translation, there should be at least one or two papers
describing some aspect(s) of the language. Existing research may be
found via the <code>Ethnologue</code> and <code>Glottolog</code> links
in the <a href="project_lgs_HG2051.html">list of languages</a>.</p>
<h4 id="identify-pos-tags-in-the-dataset">Identify POS tags in the
dataset</h4>
<p>Examine the POS tags present in the dataset. Based on existing
literature, consider whether the POS tags are appropriate for this
language. What additional POS tags might be required for this
language?</p>
<h4 id="think-through-the-problem">Think through the problem</h4>
<p>Think through the steps that would be required to develop an
automated POS tagger for this dataset. What additional resources might
be necessary? What steps would be needed to POS-tag the data? How would
you evaluate the quality of a POS tagger for this language?</p>
<h3 id="extract-verses-for-annotation">Extract verses for
annotation</h3>
<p>Write or modify code that extracts a list of verses (given in your
starter code) for observation and writes them to a file. Create a
subdirectory in your repo to store the file.</p>
<h3 id="annotate-the-sub-corpus">Annotate the sub-corpus</h3>
<p>Using whatever additional resources you can find, annotate the
sub-corpus, modifying it with more accurate annotations based on the
existing research you sourced. You may want to include the additional
resources as files in your repository or subdirectory. Determine whether
you can use automated means (i.e. a dictionary replacement) for this
process, or whether you need to do hand-annotation, or both. Make sure
that you describe and discuss your process in your writeup. At minimum,
you should add/update POS tags and/or glosses.</p>
<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>Your submission should include code, several text files, and a
writeup. More details of the requirements for these will be given in
your individual GitHub repository. In your writeup, consider the quality
of the annotations you were able to develop.</p>
