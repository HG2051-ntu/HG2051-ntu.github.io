<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project constitutes 30% of your final grade for HG2051. Please
work on the final program in groups of 2-3 and report together.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your programming
and problem-solving abilities through teamwork. If your team has an idea
for another project that you would like to do instead, talk to me for
approval.</p></li>
<li><p>This project involves developing a POS-tagger for a low-resource
language. As with the individual project, your team will be required to
submit data, output, and annotated code along with a short writeup that
describes your goals, process, and results. Your code will be assessed
based on its functionality and simplicity. Your writeup will be assessed
on its organization, clarity, comprehensiveness, and quality of the
discussion.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-2-part-of-speech-tagging">Project 2: Part of Speech
tagging</h2>
<p>As noted in Project 1, part of speech (POS) tagging is a way to
automatically identify the word class of a particular lexical item in a
string of text. A decent part of speech tagger can help to facilitate
other downstream tasks such as machine translation. In the individual
project you focused on the process of developing materials for POS
tagging for a low-resource language. In this project you will work with
other students to train a POS-tagger using the data you annotated, as
well as additional data that you will develop or source.</p>
<p>Automated POS-tagging is the process of automatically identifying or
classifying word types in sentences. Typically this is done on the basis
of FDA (Function, Distribution, Associated grammatical categories), as
per your Morphosyntax course. There are two basic approaches: 1)
rule-based, 2) statistical inference. The first approach can be useful
for complex cases, particularly when the language has been analyzed, the
second involves machine learning and can be easier when little is known
about the language. Some taggers benefit from a hybrid approach, and
this can be an iterative process.</p>
<h3 id="choose-the-language">Choose the language</h3>
<p>In your group, choose one of the low-resource languages that members
of your group worked on for Project 1. Using the dataset, develop a
POS-tagger for the chosen language.</p>
<h3 id="determine-your-approach">Determine your approach</h3>
<p>Decide how you want to approach the task of developing an automated
POS tagger: will you train a tagger, or write rules, or try some
combination of the two?</p>
<p>You also need to consider evaluation/validation of your tagger, which
will be based on the hand-tagged sentences/verses that were annotated in
Project 1. The annotated verses will be data that your tool has not
trained on, and will serve as the “gold standard” evaluation set. In
order to train/develop your tagger, you will need to find or develop
additional tagged data, either through other sources or via
hand-annotation. For best results, your training/development data should
be many more sentences (at least twice as many) as your evaluation
set.</p>
<h3 id="write-code-to-train-and-evaluate-your-tagger">Write code to
train and evaluate your tagger</h3>
<p>Together with your group, develop code that parses the
training/development data and POS-tags the annotated dataset from
Project 1, evaluating its accuracy by comparing the tags with the
gold-standard tags.</p>
<p>Starter code in your repository shows how you can use tools in the
NLTK library for training POS-taggers. You can also use other
tools/libraries to train a tagging model, and/or write parsing rules
based on your understanding of the language. The starter code also
illustrates how you can evaluate on the “gold standard” data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BONUS: in addition to POS tagging, a central concern when parsing
language is understanding dependencies between word classes. Develop a
parser for the language that identifies dependencies between words,
i.e. phrasal heads and their subordinate elements (for example, nouns
are heads of noun phrases, but dependents of verb phrases, how would you
link a particular noun with its head, and in what role relation
[subject, object, etc]?)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>Your final repository should include: - a) code that trains a tagger
on existing data, then parses the (unseen) “gold standard” data for the
language and outputs tagged data, evaluating the automatic tags against
the known tags of the “gold standard” data. Code should be
self-contained, i.e. I should be able to run it in my terminal and get
output - b) a subfolder containing all the data used for
training/testing and evaluation, with clear names for each file - c) a
writeup that lays out the task, process, and results as well as
discussion</p>
