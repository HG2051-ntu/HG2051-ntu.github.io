<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project constitutes 30% of your final grade for HG2051. Please
work on the final program in groups of 2-3 and report together.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your programming
and problem-solving abilities through teamwork. If your team has an idea
for another project that you would like to do instead, talk to me for
approval.</p></li>
<li><p>This project involves training a part of speech tagger based on
existing tagged data and using it to tag unseen data. As with the
individual project, your team will be required to submit data, output,
and annotated code along with a short writeup that describes your goals,
process, and results. Your code will be assessed based on its
functionality and simplicity.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-2-part-of-speech-tagging">Project 2: Part of speech
tagging</h2>
<p>Part of speech tagging is a way to automatically identify the word
class of a particular lexical item in a string of text. A decent part of
speech tagger can help to facilitate other downstream tasks such as
machine translation. The initial project code in the repository will
help you to get started, along the following lines:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Two text files are provided for this project, corresponding to
the two files you used for Project 1 (if you chose to work on the
language I provided files for). The first text will be used to train
your POS-tagger, and the second will be used to validate it.</p></li>
<li><p>Parse the first text into word-POS tuples and use them to train a
POS-tagger. This can be done using the NLTK library (see <a
href="https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html">NLTK Ch 5</a>), but you may
want to use a different library. Test your POS-tagger on the second text
to see how well it performs - this second text has been edited to
include only POS-tagged sentences. The metric you will use to determine
performance is <code>accuracy</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The provided script gives a baseline accuracy using modules in
the NLTK library. Your accuracy should improve once you add more data to
train your POS-tagging model. The goal of your project is to improve on
the existing baseline, by additionally including rules or features for
your POS-tagger. To explore potential rules/features, you may want to do
some research on the language itself, or find some other methods for
developing POS-taggers.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to improve your POS-tagger further, consider whether to
incorporate additional data from more sources, such as those linked in
Project 1. You may also want to train multiple POS-taggers and use them
in combination to see if you can improve your score.</p></li>
<li><p>This code is simply a starting point for exploration. What other
features can you think of and implement to improve accuracy? Are there
other lexical resources/corpora or algorithms within NLTK or from other
sources that can improve your results? What is the best accuracy you can
get? How relevant are these POS tags to other languages, i.e. would it
be good to try and convert them to something like the <a
href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/">Universal Tag
Set</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>With your group, write a roughly 5-page paper (no longer than 10
pages) describing your goals, data, process, and results, and discussing
some of the concerns identified in point 5. This paper should include
relevant linguistic information and citations for your sources. Submit
the paper as a PDF along with your annotated/commented Python code in a
Github repository. The PDF should also be submitted via
TurnItIn.</p></li>
