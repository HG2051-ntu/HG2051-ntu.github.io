<p>For this course we will use the same software, namely
<strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, and <strong>Visual Studio
Code</strong>, so that we all have nearly the same experience,
regardless of platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). We will also create a
<em>workspace</em> on our computers for storing work, Python
dependencies, software preferences, etc.; test out the creation of a
<em>virtual environment</em>; and make sure it all works. Our goal by
the end is to have a coding environment that enables a programmer’s
<em>workflow</em> so we can learn to code efficiently and write programs
that function.</p>
<p>In order to avoid confusion, there are two sets of instructions for
setting up the different operating systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="environment-setup_win.html">Windows setup</a></li>
<li><a href="environment-setup_maclinux.html">MacOS and Linux
setup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As always, I recommend reading through all instructions to understand
the goals and process before trying to follow and implement the
instructions. Our end result should be the same: a single course folder
that we can open in VSCode as a workspace, and three windows in the
workspace for viewing, editing, and running Python scripts.</p>
<p>At the end of the respective instructions, you will find a brief
discussion of workflow elements and a link to a more complete tutorial
on <a href="using-vscode.html">Using VS Code</a>, which has additional
links to more comprehensive resources.</p>
