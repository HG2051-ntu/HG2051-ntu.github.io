<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project constitutes 30% of your final grade for HG2051. Please
work on the final program in groups of 2-3 and report together.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your programming
and problem-solving abilities through teamwork. If your team has an idea
for another project that you would like to do instead, talk to the
instructor for approval.</p></li>
<li><p>Project 2 involves developing a POS-tagger for a (low-resource)
language. As with the <a href="project1">individual project</a>, your
team will be required to submit data, output, and annotated code along
with a short writeup that describes your goals, process, and results.
Your code will be assessed based on its functionality and simplicity.
Your writeup will be assessed on its organization, clarity,
comprehensiveness, and quality of the discussion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two possible options for completing Project 2. Both involve
developing a POS tagger. The first (Project 2a) uses annotated data from
Project 1 to develop a POS tagger for a low-resource language. The
second (Project 2b) uses annotated data from the Universal Dependencies
Treebanks project to train a POS tagger. If you were successful in
annotating one of the languages your team members chose for Project 1,
this is the preferred choice. If not, you can focus on using the
hand-annotated data from a UDT corpus for training/testing. Make sure to
read through both projects below to understand the scope of the
tasks.</p>
<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
<p>As noted in Project 1, part of speech (POS) tagging is a way to
automatically identify the word class of a particular lexical item in a
string of text. A decent part of speech tagger can help to facilitate
other downstream tasks such as machine translation. In the individual
project you focused on the process of developing materials for POS
tagging for a low-resource language. In this project you will work with
other students to train a POS-tagger using a combination of the data you
annotated and additional data that you will develop or source.</p>
<p>Typically, identifying or classifying word types in sentences is done
on the basis of FDA (Function, Distribution, Associated grammatical
categories), as per your Morphology and Syntax course. There are two
basic approaches to automated POS tagging:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>rule-based</li>
<li>statistical inference.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first approach can be useful for complex cases, particularly when
the language has been analyzed, while the second often involves machine
learning and can be helpful when little is known about the language.
Some taggers benefit from a hybrid approach, and this can be an
iterative process.</p>
<h2
id="project-2a-part-of-speech-tagging-for-low-resource-languages">Project
2a: Part of Speech tagging for low-resource languages</h2>
<p>For Project 2a you will work with the data that you or a group member
annotated previously. If you planned ahead, you would have all worked on
languages within the same family - this familiarity should allow you to
be successful in the group task.</p>
<h3 id="choose-the-language">Choose the language</h3>
<ul>
<li>In your group, choose one of the low-resource languages that a
member of your group worked on for Project 1. Using the dataset, develop
a POS-tagger for the chosen language. Then use the trained tagger to
re-tag the complete corpus in the <em>taggedPBC</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-2b-part-of-speech-tagging-using-a-udt-dataset">Project
2b: Part of Speech tagging using a UDT dataset</h2>
<p>For Project 2b you will work with data from the Universal
Dependencies Treebanks project for a language that is also found in the
<em>taggedPBC</em>. This will allow you to use hand-tagged data to train
a tagger for a relatively low-resource language.</p>
<h3 id="choose-the-language-1">Choose the language</h3>
<ul>
<li>A list of languages available is given <a
href="project_lgs_UD_HG2051">here</a> with links to the respective
treebanks. Using this dataset, develop a POS-tagger. Then use this
trained tagger to re-tag the respective <em>taggedPBC</em> corpus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guide-for-both-project-options">Guide for both project
options</h2>
<p>For both projects, the goal is to develop a POS tagger and use it to
tag the remaining data in the respective <em>taggedPBC</em> corpus for
the language you chose. You will evaluate the result on several grounds.
The following guide will walk you through the process.</p>
<h3 id="determine-your-approach">Determine your approach</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Decide how you want to approach the task of developing an
automated POS tagger: will you train a tagger from data, or write rules,
or try some combination of the two?</p></li>
<li><p>You also need to consider evaluation/validation of your tagger,
which will be based either on the hand-tagged sentences/verses that were
annotated in Project 1 or on a portion of the hand-tagged sentences of
the UDT corpus for the language that you chose. The set of annotated
verses will be data that your tool has not trained on, and will serve as
the “gold standard” evaluation set. In order to train/develop your
tagger, you may need to find or develop additional tagged data, either
through other sources or via hand-annotation. For best results, your
training/development data should be many more sentences (at least twice
as many) as your evaluation set.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="write-code-to-train-and-evaluate-your-tagger">Write code to
train and evaluate your tagger</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Together with your group, develop code that parses the
training/development data and re-tags either the annotated dataset from
Project 1 or a set of 20 sentences from the UDT for POS, evaluating its
accuracy by comparing the newly generated tags with the “gold standard”
tags.</p></li>
<li><p>Starter code in your repository shows how you can use tools in
the NLTK library for training POS-taggers. You can also use other
tools/libraries to train a tagging model, and/or write parsing rules
based on your understanding of the language.</p></li>
<li><p>The starter code also illustrates how you can evaluate on the
“gold standard” data.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>: <em>in addition to POS tagging, a central
concern when parsing language is understanding dependencies between word
classes. Develop a parser for the language that identifies dependencies
between words, i.e. phrasal heads and their subordinate elements (for
example, nouns are heads of noun phrases, but dependents of verb
phrases, how would you link a particular noun with its head, and in what
role relation [subject, object, etc]?)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="predict-tags-for-the-taggedpbc-corpus">Predict tags for the
<em>taggedPBC</em> corpus</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Using the POS tagger that you trained, predict tags for the
verses in the <em>taggedPBC</em> for the language that you chose. Code
is included to illustrate the basics of this process.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the result with the initial state of the corpus, by
examining the number/type of each POS tag in your final corpus. Was your
POS-tagger able to increase the number of identified items in a given
word class? Was it able to identify a larger number of classes?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>Your final repository should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>code that trains a tagger on existing data, then parses the
(unseen) “gold standard” data for the language and outputs tagged data,
evaluating the automatic tags against the known tags of the “gold” data.
In addition, your code should re-tag the initial corpus and collect
statistics on the POS tags in both the initial and the resulting
corpora. Code should be self-contained, i.e. I should be able to run it
in my terminal and get output</p></li>
<li><p>a subfolder containing all the data used for training/testing and
evaluation, with clear names for each file</p></li>
<li><p>a writeup that lays out the task, process, and results, as well
as discussion of the challenges, concerns, and potential
improvements</p></li>
