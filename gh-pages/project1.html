<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project constitutes 30% of your final grade for HG2051. Please
work on the final program and report individually. Your code will be
assessed based on its functionality and simplicity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your programming
and reasoning abilities by working on a problem individually. If you
have an idea for another project that you would like to do instead, talk
to me for approval.</p></li>
<li><p>This project involves sorting, searching, and classifying lexical
resources. Submission requirements include your data, output, and
annotated code along with a short writeup describing your goals,
process, and results.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-1-multilingual-search">Project 1: Multilingual
search</h2>
<p>While it is relatively easy to search through a corpus of text to
find particular words/collocations/phrases in a single language, there
are very few search tools that will allow you to find matches based on
multiple languages. For this project you will develop a program that
will return matches from multiple levels of an interlinear text.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You will choose two interlinear texts from a low-resource
language that have been glossed and translated into English. The first
text is to be used for developing your tool, and the second is intended
to validate your tool. You will be provided some texts but may choose a
different language if you like, the only requirement being that it must
have two interlinearized linguistic texts with multiple tiers of
analysis (i.e. <em>text</em>, <em>gloss</em>, <em>part of speech
(pos)</em>). Some examples include <a
href="https://www.humancomp.org/wadict/vm/texts/">these Wa texts</a> and
<a href="https://negation.univie.ac.at/sprachen/nenzischa.html">these
texts in Nenets</a>. Depending on your source you may need to do
more/less processing.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a Python script that will read in the text, store it, and
allow for a user to search the data on multiple levels simultaneously,
i.e. <em>text</em>, <em>gloss</em>, <em>pos</em>. The idea here is that
the user should be able to query for all <code>nouns</code> that have
the gloss <strong>dog</strong>, and look at all sentences with those
forms in order to observe the context in which they occur. The
implementation should enable searching using at least two levels of
annotation (i.e. <em>text</em>, <em>gloss</em>), but will receive a
higher score if more than two annotation levels are supported, as well
as if forward and backward searches (i.e. “all words with POS
<code>n</code> preceded by POS <code>clitic</code>”) are possible.
Output should be presented minimally in the terminal or written to a
file.</p></li>
<li><p>Once your Python script is working for the first text, test it on
the second text to make sure that it works, and make any necessary
changes so that it works for both texts. Finally, modify your program so
that you can search across both texts simultaneously.
<strong>Bonus:</strong> get it to work on multiple additional texts in
the same format, sourced from the original repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a short paper (no longer than 5 pages) describing your
goals, data, process, and results. This paper should include some
background information on Pnar (or another language you chose), with
relevant linguistic information and citations for your sources. Submit
this paper as a PDF along with your annotated/commented Python code and
the texts you chose in a Github repository. The PDF should also be
submitted via TurnItIn. Make sure to provide examples of your queries
and results in the paper or as separate files, and describe any
challenges you faced. Also ensure that your name and matric number are
clearly indicated in your code and in your PDF submission.</p></li>
