title: Configuring a Development Environment
---

For this course we will use the same software, namely **Python**,
**Git**, and **Visual Studio Code**, so that we all have nearly the same
experience, regardless of platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). We will also
create a *workspace* on our computers for storing work, Python dependencies,
software preferences, etc.; test out the creation of a *virtual environment*;
and make sure it all works. Our goal by the end is to have a coding environment
that enables a programmer's *workflow* so we can learn to code efficiently
and write programs that function.

In order to avoid confusion, there are two sets of instructions for setting
up the different operating systems:

- [Windows setup](environment-setup_win.html)

- [MacOS and Linux setup](environment-setup_maclinux.html)

As always, I recommend reading through all instructions to understand the
goals and process before trying to follow and implement the instructions. Our
end result should be the same: a single course folder that we can open
in VSCode as a workspace, and three windows in the workspace for viewing,
editing, and running Python scripts.

At the end of the respective instructions, you will find a brief discussion of
workflow elements and a link to a more complete tutorial on
[Using VS Code](using-vscode.html), which has additional links to more
comprehensive resources.
