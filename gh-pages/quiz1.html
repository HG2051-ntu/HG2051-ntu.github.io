<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h2>
<p>This quiz will require you to use your knowledge of Python
programming and the skills and concepts that have been covered in the
first half of the course.</p>
<p>You will want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to manipulate and work with various objects: <code>str</code>,
<code>list</code>, <code>dict</code>, <code>tuple</code></li>
<li>how to write/define/use functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to work with the <code>nltk</code> library</li>
<li>how to access corpora such as the <code>gutenberg</code> corpus and
the <code>swadesh</code> corpus</li>
<li>how to access information in lexical resources such as
<code>wordnet</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the quiz will require you to read/write information from/to
a file.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-complete-the-quiz">How to complete the quiz</h2>
<p>On the day of the quiz you will be provided a link to a personalized
Github repository, which you will clone to disk, following the
procedures we have established with the homework assignments. A starter
script will be provided in the Github repository, along with a
<code>README</code> file detailing the requirements for completing the
quiz. Read this carefully before starting. On your own computer, you
will use your development environment, following the standard coding
procedures we have been practicing for the past weeks (read/write/edit
code in the editor, save changes, run script in terminal, repeat). This
will require you to be aware of file locations, some terminal commands,
and other basics of computer science.</p>
<h2 id="additional-information-and-submission">Additional information
and submission</h2>
<p>The quiz is open-book, open-internet, but I will be monitoring for
social media use and collusion. You will have 1.5 hours to complete the
challenge. Final commits to your repository will be late after this time
period and marked down accordingly. Your final submission will be
assessed on whether the requirements are satisfied (whether the program
runs and produces the specified output) as well as the quality of the
code and annotation (comments explaining how it works).</p>
