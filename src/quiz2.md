title: 'HG2051 (AY24/25) Quiz 2: Coding challenge'
---

## What you need to know

This quiz will require you to use your knowledge of Python programming and the
skills and concepts that have been covered throughout the course.

You will want to know:

 - how to manipulate and work with various objects: `str`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`
 - how to write/define/use functions
 - how to annotate your code and demonstrate algorithmic thinking (logical processes)

You will also need to know:

 - how to use `nltk` for processing text (i.e. frequency distributions)
 - how to download data from the internet (urls)
 - how to tag words for part of speech
 - how to use resources for languages other than English
 - how to install libraries in your virtual environment using `pip` from the command line
 - how to use the `pandas` library to manipulate dataframes

Finally, the quiz will require you to read/write information from/to a file.

## How to complete the quiz

On the day of the quiz you will be provided a link to a personalized Github
repository, which you will clone to disk, following the procedures we have
established with the homework assignments. A starter script will be provided in
the Github repository, along with a `README` file detailing the requirements for
completing the quiz. Read this carefully before starting.

On your own computer, you will use your development environment, following the
standard coding procedures we have been practicing for the past weeks
(read/write/edit code in the editor, save changes, run script in terminal,
repeat). This will require you to be aware of file locations, some terminal
commands, and other basics of computer science.

Your final submission should allow me to run the quiz script in the terminal
and get the necessary output.

## Additional information and submission

The quiz is open-book, open-internet, but I will be monitoring for social media
use and collusion. You will have 2 hours to complete the challenge. Final
commits to your repository will be late after this time period and marked down
accordingly. Your final submission will be assessed on whether the requirements
are satisfied (whether the program runs and produces the specified output) as
well as the quality of the code and annotation (comments explaining how it
works and notes/readme explaining your thought process).
